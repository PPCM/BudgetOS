## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm >= 9.0.0
- Docker (optional, for PostgreSQL/MariaDB)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd BudgetOS

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment config
cp .env.example .env

# Run database migrations
npm run db:migrate

# (Optional) Seed demo data
npm run db:seed
```

### Development Mode

```bash
# Start backend with hot reload
npm run dev

# Start frontend (separate terminal)
cd client && npm run dev
```

### Production Build

```bash
# Build frontend and start server
./budgetos.sh build
```

---

## Testing

### Test Commands

```bash
# Unit tests (backend)
npm test

# Integration tests (SQLite in-memory)
npm run test:integration

# Unit + integration
npm run test:all

# E2E browser tests (Playwright)
npm run test:e2e

# Full suite across all 3 databases
npm run test:global
```

### Multi-Database Testing

BudgetOS supports three database backends. To test against PostgreSQL and MariaDB:

```bash
# Start test database containers
docker compose -f docker-db/docker-compose.mariadb.yml up -d
docker compose -f docker-db/docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d

# Create test databases
docker exec budgetos-mariadb mariadb -uroot -pbudgetos_root \
  -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS budgetos_test; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON budgetos_test.* TO 'budgetos'@'%';"

docker exec budgetos-postgres psql -U budgetos -d postgres \
  -c "CREATE DATABASE budgetos_test OWNER budgetos;"

# Run integration tests on specific database
TEST_DB_CLIENT=mysql2 MYSQL_DB=budgetos_test npm run test:integration
TEST_DB_CLIENT=pg POSTGRES_DB=budgetos_test npm run test:integration
```

### E2E Tests

```bash
# Start test databases
docker compose -f docker-db/docker-compose.e2e.yml up -d --wait

# Run on all databases
npm run test:e2e:all-dbs

# Run on a specific database
npm run test:e2e:sqlite
npm run test:e2e:postgres
npm run test:e2e:mysql

# Stop containers
docker compose -f docker-db/docker-compose.e2e.yml down
```

### Global Test Suite

```bash
npm run test:global
```

**Warning**: The SQLite database is automatically deleted at the end, so the application starts in bootstrap mode afterward. Either:
- Run `npm run db:seed` to restore demo data
- Register a new admin account through the UI
